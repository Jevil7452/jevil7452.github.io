<h1>Installing Plus! XP on 64-bit computers</h1>
<p>If you have ever tried to install Plus! for Windows XP on a modern, 64-bit computer, you've probably saw this error message:</p>
<img src=error.png>
<p>If you want to bypass this error message, and install it anyways, here's what you need to do:</p>
Firstly, you need to download the Windows SDK ISO from 
<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2173746">here</a>
<p>After you have downloaded it, open it, then navigate to the Installers folder, and run "Orca-x86_en-us.msi"</p>
<p>This will install the Orca MSI editor, which you will need to use to modify the Plus! XP installer.</p>
<p>Now, copy the Plus! XP CD contents to a directory on your computer (assuming you have a CD of it)</p>
<p>After you have done so, find the file "Microsoft Plus! for Windows XP.msi", right click on it and select "Edit with Orca"</p>
<p>After selecting this option, you will see a window like the one below:</p>

<p>On the left side, you need to locate the "Property" entry. After you click on it, you will see the screen below:</p>

<p>Now, in the list, you need to locate "SIXTYFOURBIT" and change it from a "0" to a "1", like below:</p>
<img src=sixtyfourbit.png>
<p>Now, select File>Save</p>
<p>You can now start the installer, and if you've done everything correctly, you will see it start like normal!</p>

<p>Now, you can proceed with the installation like usual. Note, that not all features might work correctly on new versions of Windows.</p>
<p>If you get an error saying that Windows Installer stopped working, you can close it and the install will continue anyways.</p>
