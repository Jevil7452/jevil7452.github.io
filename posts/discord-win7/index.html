				<h1>Discord on Windows 7</h1>
				How to get the latest version of the Discord client working on Windows 7<br>
				You will also need VxKex installed.
			</div>
			<h5>Update 2024-08-08: 1.0.9157 works too.</h5>
			<h3>On your Windows 7 PC</h3>
			<h4>Step 1: Install 64-bit Discord 1.0.9034</h4>
			This is the latest version of Discord to run on Windows 7 officially, and what the Windows 7/8.1 installer had, albeit 32-bit.<br>
			You can download it from <a href="https://dl.discordapp.net/distro/app/stable/win/x64/1.0.9034/DiscordSetup.exe">here</a> or the Download Center.<br>
			After that, just install it.<br>

			<sub>Honestly, you could stop here, 1.0.9034 should keep working for the forseeable future</sub>
			<h4>Step 2: Extract the latest Discord client</h4>
			You can download it from <a href="https://discord.com/api/downloads/distributions/app/installers/latest?channel=stable&platform=win&arch=x64">here</a><br>
			At the time of writing, it is version 1.0.9154.<br>
			After downloading, open the setup file with 7-Zip, then open the .nupkg file, and navigate to the lib folder.<br>
			The net45 folder is the Discord files. Extract it to the desktop.<br>

			<h4>Step 3: Replace Discord 1.0.9034 with whatever the latest is</h4>
			Go to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Discord<br>
			Do not delete app-1.0.9034, doing so will cause the updater to redownload it.<br>
			Go into the app-1.0.9034 folder, and empty it out.<br>
			Copy in the contents of the net45 folder you extracted earlier.<br>
			<h4>Step 4: Make it work</h4>
			Now, to make it all work, edit Discord.exe with CFF Explorer and change the subsystem version to 6.1.<br>

			Make the highlighted values be 0006 and 0001 respectively.<br>
			Then, go up a folder and enable VxKex on Update.exe<br>
			Now, just run it.<br>
